# Safe&Sound (Scrapped)
Safe Sound is a React Native application that detects the speed of a nearby driver for safer driving.  
Due to the API limitations from the Smart Car API, we decided that the idea had to be scrapped.

# Developers
- Pravat Bhusal (React Native & Flask Developer)
- Michael Kasman (Algorithms & Flask Developer)

# Technologies
- React Native
- Python (Flask)
- SmartCar API

# DISCLAIMER
Due to the idea being unfinished and scrapped, the code is very unoptimized and jumbled without any proper documentation. If you plan on running this mobile application on a test instance, beware of many bugs. This application is only open-source for educational purposes, only.
